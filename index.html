        <h1>Well, hey, looks like you found it to my corner of the internet. Why, dunno.</h1>

        <p>Purpose of this website: coding tutorials, project updates, and trying to prove I can use HTML.</p>
        <p>Also, a place to rant about Python, C++, C#, Java, and JS (the languages I know)</p>
